# TechCrush Capstone Project

Welcome to the **TechCrush Capstone Project**! This repository contains the codebase and documentation for a capstone project designed to demonstrate data analysis and machine learning skills using a real-world healthcare dataset.

## Project Overview

TechCrush is a data analytics project that leverages the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) to explore and predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on medical attributes.  
This project is intended for evaluation purposes only and showcases the use of Jupyter Notebooks and Kaggle Notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Data Source

- **Dataset:** [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Description:** Contains diagnostic measurements and medical information used to predict the onset of diabetes within five years for Pima Indian women aged 21 and above.
- **Attributes include:** Number of pregnancies, glucose concentration, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.

## Technologies Used

- **Kaggle Notebooks**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Python** (for data processing and analysis)
- **Key libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Features

- Data exploration and cleaning of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database
- Statistical and visual analysis of health attributes
- Machine learning models for diabetes prediction (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees)
- Evaluation and comparison of model performance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Access to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (for Kaggle Notebooks)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) (for local execution)
- Python 3.8 or higher (if running locally)
- Required Python libraries (see below)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MoffatMose/TechCrush-Capstone-Project.git
    cd TechCrush-Capstone-Project
    ```

2. **Download the dataset:**
    - Visit the [Kaggle dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) and download `diabetes.csv`.
    - Place the dataset in the appropriate location as referenced in the notebooks (usually the project root or a `/data` folder).

3. **Install dependencies**
    ```
   manually install:  
    `pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter`
